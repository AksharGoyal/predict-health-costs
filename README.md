## Used simple Machine Learning to predict health costs

As part of freeCodeCamp's Machine Learning with Python, I had to work on the project "Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator". I used a simple Tensorflow regression model (with EarlyStopping to reduce overfitting) to predict healthcare costs. It was a fun project where I calculated various insights.

Take your time to explore the notebook and enjoy learning ðŸ“ˆ
